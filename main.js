/*
Create an object that works as a quiz program. The quiz object needs to have an
array of objects with the properties: quiz questions, quiz answers and a property
to check if the answer is answered correctly.
It also needs a function to run the quiz program. The function needs to prompt
the user for a question. (Hint: use prompt in JSâ€¦ google it)
when the question is answered it needs to check if the answer is correct or not
and then go to the next question. Finally the function should inform the quiz
player how many questions answered correctly.
To solve this exercise you can use "prompt"(to prompt the user for an answer) and
"alert" to inform the user.... e.g. how many questions were answered correctly.
You should NOT use the DOM.
